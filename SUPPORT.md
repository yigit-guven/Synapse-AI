# Support for Synapse AI

Thank you for using Synapse AI! We are dedicated to helping you get your private RAG infrastructure up and running.

## 🔍 Before You Ask

Since Synapse AI runs on your local infrastructure (VPS/Docker), many issues may be related to your specific environment. Before opening an issue, please check the following:

1.  **Documentation**: Have you read the [README.md](README.md) and installation guide?
2.  **Docker Logs**: If the container isn't starting, check the logs:
    ```bash
    docker logs synapse-ai-backend
    ```
3.  **Hardware Requirements**: Ensure your VPS meets the minimum requirements (RAM/CPU) for running the selected LLM.
4.  **Existing Issues**: Search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yigit-guven/Synapse-AI/issues) to see if someone else has had the same problem.

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs
