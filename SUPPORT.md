# Support for Synapse AI

Thank you for choosing Synapse AI. We are dedicated to supporting your self-hosted RAG infrastructure.

## Troubleshooting

Since Synapse AI runs on local infrastructure (VPS/Docker), issues are often environment-specific. Before opening an issue, please verify the following:

1.  **Documentation**: Ensure you have reviewed the [README.md](README.md) and installation guide.
2.  **Docker Logs**: If the container fails to start, investigate the logs:
    ```bash
    docker logs synapse-ai-backend
    ```
3.  **Hardware Requirements**: Verify your VPS meets the minimum requirements (RAM/CPU) for the selected LLM.
4.  **Existing Issues**: Search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yigit-guven/Synapse-AI/issues) for similar reported problems.
