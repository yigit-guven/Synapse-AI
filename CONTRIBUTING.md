# Contributing to Synapse AI

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Synapse AI! We are a small team building a robust, self-hosted RAG infrastructure, and we welcome help from the community.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please create a GitHub Issue. Be sure to include:
* A descriptive title.
* Steps to reproduce the error.
* Expected vs. actual behavior.
* Your environment details (OS, Python version, Hardware).

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements
We welcome ideas for new features, especially those focused on:
* Optimizing RAG performance on low-resource hardware.
* Better handling of German language nuances.
* New document parsers.

### 3. Pull Request Process
1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure your code follows our style guide (see below).
4.  Make sure your code lints.
5.  Issue that pull request!

## 💻 Development Standards

* **Code Style**: We follow **PEP 8** standards for Python code.
* **Documentation**: All new functions and classes must have docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
* **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages. Start with a verb (e.g., "Add PDF parser," "Fix vector dimension mismatch").

## 🧪 Testing
Before submitting a PR, please run the test suite (instructions to be added as project matures) to ensure no regressions.

Thank you for helping us build the future of private document intelligence!
